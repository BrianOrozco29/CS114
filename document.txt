When considering choice of data structure use in  database
system that manages customer accounts, we see that a data structure that
has little concern for  cost of deletion, but is highly efficient for search
and moderately efficient for insertion, should meet  resource constraints
imposed by this problem. Records are accessible by unique account number
(sometimes called an exact-match query). One data structure that meets
se requirements is  hash table described in Chapter 9.4. Hash tables
allow for extremely fast exact-match search. A record can be modified
quickly when  modification does not affect its space requirements. Hash
tables also support efficient insertion of new records. While deletions can
also be supported efficiently,o many deletions lead some degradation
in performance for  remaining operations. However,  hash table can
be reorganized periodically restore  system peak efficiency. Such
reorganization can occur offline so as not affect ATM transactions.
